Okular is a multifaceted program that I use almost every day for my PDF reading and annotating needs, although it can do much more. Sadly, its website was a bit outdated and not mobile friendly. I thus proposed to rewrite the Okular website using the HUGO framework, in a similar way as was done with the kde.org main website, and keeping consistency with other KDE applications such as Konsole. Fortunately, some work was already initiated by Carl Schwan, so I only needed to continue and finish his work.\nMentors Carl Schwan Links Repositories\nOfficial Repo where all work will be merged Working Repo Work Done January 2021 I didnt do much in January, as it was the \u0026ldquo;partiels\u0026rdquo; (final exams) month at INSA and I was really caught up studying. But, back in Spain, there was a lot of snow! Which is super nice :p\nFebruary 2021 I started by porting the Anouncements section from Raw HTML to Markdown, for which I wrote a small script. Then, I configured the project to use aether-sass (KDE\u0026rsquo;s HUGO standard theme) as a Go module, as Git submodules were less desirable. Next, I added a FAQ section, which was easy since most questions had been removed from the FAQ in a recent cleanup. For this, I used the \u0026lt;/details\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; HTML labels, which I didnt know about and which seem super cool to me. Finally, I added the new /download and /build-it pages, as well as a new index, using a mixture of HUGO markdown and raw html templates.\nMarch 2021 Having added the index page as a raw html template, now I needed to add i18n support; this was achieved by using the {{i18n}} HUGO template, which I also used in the /applications table of supported formats. Next, I added the /contact page, which I redesigned and updated to include matrix. I modified the index to include a refference to Okular\u0026rsquo;s upcoming PDF signing support (¬°so neat! I might finally stop using Autofirma), cleaned up unnecesary files that were left from the transition, and added a Site Search functionality that works client-side and does not depend on google, insipired by (some might even say \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;copied\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;from\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; / en los mentideros dir√°n que \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;copiado de\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;) eddieweb\u0026rsquo;s popular gist.\nApril 2021 All work on the project was finished.

It has a google-independent in-page search, although it does not use lunar.js as was suggested, and the development news are now in its own section, although the changelogs were left outside of the individual posts for practical reasons. The screenshots and other have been updated, but most of them have been removed as we have decided for a simpler homepage which highlights the most important features of the program.\nIn all, most features in the old webpage have been kept, while adding a more modern redesign which increases usability and makes the project more attractive and coherent with the KDE aesthetic.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt The HTML labels \u0026lt;/details\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; exist! This has been super useful, as I have already used that knowledge in my personal webpage :p How to use HUGO in general, and HUGO i18n in particular That, in my opinion, HUGO is not only much more modular and adaptable than, for example, WordPress, but, for people who know how to use the command terminal, it is even simpler than Wordpress itself That Okular is adding PDF Signatures support!

Sadly, its website is a bit outdated and not mobile friendly. I thus propose to rewrite the Okular website using the HUGO framework, in a similar way as was done with the kde.org main website, keeping consistency with other KDE applications such as Konsole. Fortunately, some work was already initiated by Carl Schwan, so I would only need to continue and finish his work.\nProject Goals The updated Okular webpage should be beautiful, present the information in a clear way, and be easy to use. Some desired features are:\nMobile-friendliness In-page search that is independent from google, i.e. using Lunar Search Updated screenshot section (the screenshots look outdated to me, but maybe its just that they were taken on a different platform) A more blog-like interface for the development news, maybe keeping the changelogs inside the Okular webpage Also, features already present in the current webpage, such as multilanguage support, should be preserved.\nImplementation As previously stated, work was already initiated by Carl Schwan. The project uses the HUGO framework and some python scripts for i18n. Feedback from the Okular devs would be gathered throughout the process to ensure the new website accommodates their needs. Regarding the documentation, I believe that a basic description of how to make the site work would suffice, since HUGO is ultimately producing simple HTML/CSS/JS.\nTimeline Jan 13th: Start of work according to the KDE website Jan 15th - Jan 24thth: Familiarization with the platform and learning its inner workings. I am leaving lots of time here in case this ends up being more difficult than I believe, but possibly it could be done in a shorter time Jan 24th - Jan 31st: Last week of the semester at INSA, I will probably have presentations and work to do Feb 1st - Feb 12th: Coding time Feb 13th - Feb 21st: Vacations in France, if possible due to coronavirus I might go on vacation, so it would be difficult to code now Feb 22nd - March 28th: Coding time March 29th - April 4th: Work should be done by now, time to write a report on how everything went April 5th - April 9th: Last week before vacations in France, so it is possible that I will have work to do at uni April 9th: End of work according to the KDE website About Me I am a computational biotechnology student at UPMadrid currently doing an ERASMUS at INSA Lyon. I love open source, and use Kubuntu -hence, KDE- as my operating system of choice, and I would like to give back to the community by contributing something back. Although I mostly work with python (especially the BioPython package), I have previously used HUGO to make my personal website, pablomarcos.me, where more personal information and my full CV can be found. I have also worked on another project with a user facing UI: Who\u0026rsquo;s that Function, an interactive game that teaches first grade students the properties of functions, as part of a teacher-student collaboration scholarship; although it is not super related.\nI am completely comfortable working remotely, as I already did so for the aforementioned game due to COVID-19 restrictions, and, although English is not my native language, I can write and speak it fluently. I can also speak Spanish, my mother tongue, and French.\nP.S.: Also, back in Spain, there was a lot of snow! Which is super nice :p although some people (my mother included) were trapped in their jobs.

It was all like that since it all began. First laughter, then tears. First happiness, then a world of fear. She didnt know how everything had happened, but it had.\nIt all started two years ago, with a boy more beautiful than the world had ever known. With two eyes like stars and a hair like gold, not because of its colour but because of the way it shone. She fell in love, but never knew the reason why; he never loved her, but who cares? She was in the sea, and love was an island there.\nAnd after hundreds and hundreds of stares at the stars; after suffering of love, after suffering so bad, she used a silver knife and got out of the dark.\nüì∏ : Photo by\u0026hellip; Hum!
