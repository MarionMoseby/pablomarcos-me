Abstract Pneumonia is a serious illness characterised by a severe cough with phlegm, fever, chills and shortness of breath, which is caused by inflammation of the alveoli in one or both lungs. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung infections, pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in adults in the United States, with more than six million cases of acute pneumonia each year, one million of which require hospitalisation.</description></item><item><title>Report on Single Cell Genomics</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/gdav/single-cell-genomics/final-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/gdav/single-cell-genomics/final-report/</guid><description>Introduction Single-cell omics technologies are a series of scientific methods that allow us to investigate the variations that exist, at the individual level, in the expression of the different cells that make up a whole, whether this is a tissue, a colony of bacteria, or even a human being.[@paolillo_single-cell_2019] Through these ultra-detailed analyses, we can identify exactly which molecular characteristics correspond to certain clinical outcomes, and therefore allow us to go beyond the &amp;ldquo;macro&amp;rdquo; paradigm in which we have been working until now.</description></item><item><title>DO NOT PICK THIS SUBJECT!!</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/gab/warning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/gab/warning/</guid><description>To any UPM&amp;rsquo;s Master in Computational Biology students that might be reading this, i have a strong warning to make:

Using parameters defined in previous literature, we have created a cellular automaton capable of representing, in a simple way, the complex synchronisation mechanisms behind this coleopteran species. Using descriptive statistical methods, we concluded that the most important parameter for defining the system is the size of the network, much more so than the initial proportion of each class of individual or the ratio of influenceability by neighbours, and we were able to test the robustness of our results using Machine Learning, a completely different method that nevertheless supports the same conclusions.</description></item><item><title>Using Computational Methods to discover novel drugs for the treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/lead-discovery/assignment-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/lead-discovery/assignment-3/</guid><description>Abstract Androgenetic alopecia is a genetic variation that causes hair loss on the scalp due to hypersensitivity of hair follicles to didydrotestosterone (DHT).

Not only did we improve Ki (from 26 nM in FNS to 21 nM), but our candidate remains 63% more selective to type II than to type I, which we hope will allow it to avoid FNS’s side effects.</description></item><item><title>SPARQL Queries</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-5/</guid><description>SPARQL is a query language and protocol for searching, adding, modifying or deleting RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph data available on the Internet.

Introduction Climate change is a term that refers to a lasting change in the statistical parameters of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s global climate or its various regional climates. These changes may be due to processes intrinsic to the Earth, to external influences or, more recently, to human activities. The Industrial Revolution has led to a change in the composition of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities (and in which natural variations can also play a role).</description></item><item><title>ELIXIO : a synthetic microbial consortium for sustainable violet fragrances</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/biolog%C3%ADa-programable/presentation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/biolog%C3%ADa-programable/presentation/</guid><description>For our presentation, we told the class about ELIXIO, an iGEM 2021 awarded project on developing sustainaible alternatives to the fragances world.

Abstract Knowledge representation is an area of artificial intelligence whose fundamental goal is to represent knowledge in a way that facilitates the inference of new data. This discipline studies how to think formally - how to use a system of symbols to represent a domain of discourse, along with functions that allow formal reasoning about objects.
In this paper, we will analyze the inner workings of knowledge representation, providing a simplified approach to the discipline and a practical example on how it can be applied to improve a Machine Learning Model.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing the probability and time of fixation of random neutral mutations in silico</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/biolog%C3%ADa-evolutiva/exercise-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/biolog%C3%ADa-evolutiva/exercise-1/</guid><description>Abstract Biological clocks are molecular mechanisms present in living organisms that allow scientists to estimate the passage of time. In this task, we will use a computer model to simulate the evolution over time of a neutral mutation appearing in the genome of a living being in a population N, analyzing its fixation capacity and the average time it takes for fixation to occur. It is precisely through these mechanisms that it is possible to analyze the passage of time since the appearance of a mutation, as has recently happened in the Juan Maeso case.</description></item><item><title>Preferential Attachment Networks</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/beyond-erdos-renyi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/beyond-erdos-renyi/</guid><description>In the last exercise, we used an Erdös-Rényi random attachment model to analyze how interconnections influence the spread of illness over space. Erdös-Rényi, however, is not the only model that exists, and others, such as Preferential Attachment Networks, have the advantage of being more true to reality and an even closer representation of reality.
In these models, unlike in the random models, there is a preference when forming links between nodes: normally, nodes tend to cluster around the nodes with the largest number of linked nodes, promoting centralization and improving the connection between nodes; in this way, for example, the diameter of the network tends to decrease, since most nodes can be connected by traveling to the &amp;ldquo;mother node&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>The Erdös-Rényi model</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/networks/</guid><description>In the last assignment, we explored the role that spacial distribution played in the evolution of different functions over time, but playing with Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life.

The Lisbet experiment, for example, demonstrated that the actions we take are previously and unconsciously decided by the brain, and that it is then that our consciousness, our &amp;ldquo;inner voice&amp;rdquo;, feels the desire to perform these actions, thus ruling out the possibility of a thinking entity outside the constraints of the physical world.</description></item><item><title>The Cellular Automata</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/celular-automata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/modelizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistemas-biol%C3%B3gicos/celular-automata/</guid><description>A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation consisting on a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created according to some fixed rule that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood.</description></item><item><title>Finding Orthologues in Arabidopsis Thaliana</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-4/</guid><description>The idea for this assignment is find the orthologue pairs between species Arabidopsis and S. pombe using BioRuby to do BLAST and parse the BLAST-generated reports.

This formulation, which was motivated by the behaviour of both physical and biological oscilators, has found widespread application in neuroscience.
The model makes several assumptions, including that there is weak coupling, that the oscillators are identical or nearly identical, and that interactions depend sinusoidally on the phase difference between each pair of objects.</description></item><item><title>Your worst nightmare</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/es/posts/master-en-biolog%C3%ADa-computacional/bioinfo-programming-challenges/assignment-2/</guid><description>A recent paper executes a meta-analysis of a few thousand published co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis.
