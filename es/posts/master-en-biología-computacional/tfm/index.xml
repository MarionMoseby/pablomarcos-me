In this publication, we present CanGraph, a software solution that allows its users to annotate and interpret unknown metabolites by making use of five pre-existing databases (HMDB, SMPDB, DrugBank, ExposomeExplorer and Wikidata) and five search criteria (InChI, InChIKey, Structural Similarity, HMDB_ID, Name and ChEBI ID), resulting in an output database in GraphML format containing the associations to the different metabolic pathways, tissues and organisms to which these molecules may belong.</description></item></channel></rss>
