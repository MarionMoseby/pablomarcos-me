We want to perform a PCA on this data to see how the data is structured and to try and make some educated guesses.

Our goal is to perform a Principal Component Analysis across the samples, to try and find out if we can relate said gene expresion profiles to a series of known biomarkers.

Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to integrate diverse types of single-cell data. In this exercise, we will learn to use it!

Project Description Our lab has identified an hot spring in Iceland, which, in the spring, undergoes events of high temperature (~90 ºC), producing algae blooms. Our intention is to study this blooms, performing an in-depth genomic and metagenomic exploration of this singular ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
