Abstract Knowledge representation is an area of artificial intelligence whose fundamental goal is to represent knowledge in a way that facilitates the inference of new data. This discipline studies how to think formally - how to use a system of symbols to represent a domain of discourse, along with functions that allow formal reasoning about objects.
In this paper, we will analyze the inner workings of knowledge representation, providing a simplified approach to the discipline and a practical example on how it can be applied to improve a Machine Learning Model.</description></item></channel></rss>
