In the february post, I mentioned how I ordered the material that was on Carl Schwan's MVP for the Index page, explaining Okular's main features. Now that that was set, I had to add support for i18n, as it can be difficult for translators to work with a raw html template. [This was achieved by using the {{i18n}} HUGO template](https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan/okular-kde-org/-/commit/a042f38d0fe1d781860a0056721e66349393b997), which specifies the translatable parts by using `{{ i18n "Section.variable" }}` in each of the strings to translate, and then mapping the values into a yaml file such as:

<details>
<summary>/i18n/en.yaml</summary>
{{< highlight yaml >}}
#Name of the translatable section
Section.variable:
    other: "English translation for variable"
Section.othervariable:
    other: "English translation for othervariable"
Section.yetanothervariable:
    other: "English translation for yetanothervariable"
{{< /highlight >}}
</details>

I also used this to translate the table of supported formats in /applications. The final result can be seen here:

A cool homepage with i18 support

And the list of file formats Okular can open
{{< /split >}}

Next, [I added the /contact page](https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan/okular-kde-org/-/commit/0e7989a171c36f2d7d0b32332a43a490a27ccf59), which I redesigned and updated to include matrix. [I modified the index](https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan/okular-kde-org/-/commit/1795c0da36113ee0219a69d66bfce1595218f94c) to include a refference to Okular's [upcoming PDF signing support](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/296) (Â¡so neat! I might finally stop using [Autofirma](https://github.com/ctt-gob-es/clienteafirma)), and [cleaned up unnecesary files that were left from the transition](https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan/okular-kde-org/-/commit/9cab0470f744252ecff9ef9721f71de084167dfb)

If you want to contact the developers, there is info on the contact page

You will be able to sign your own pdfs as well as view and verify other signatures.

I also wanted to add client-side [Site Search](https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan/okular-kde-org/-/commit/05ce2a78d2b77d4e4e4e19e64a7e3601856095bf), as the one that existed was really just a button that redirected the search query to a google search. I was inspired by (some might even say *copied*) [eddieweb's popular gist](https://gist.github.com/eddiewebb/735feb48f50f0ddd65ae5606a1cb41ae), which not only does not require to install additional packages, but also highlights the matches, using JSON and Fuse.js. It was easy to add, but I am still proud! ðŸ¤© It's nice to help the web transition away from google ðŸ˜Š You can see how that looks like here:

{{< figure src="/posts/Imagenes/okular-search.png" alt="New Okular Website's search section" >}}
You can search using the navbar, and results are highlighted

So, it was a month with lots of work, but the site is finally ready! ðŸ¥³
