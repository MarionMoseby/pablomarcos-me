I was a finalist in the [2020 Wine and Oil Label Design Contest](http://www.etsiaab.upm.es/?id=7ad21db0c0826710VgnVCM10000009c7648a____&prefmt=articulo&fmt=detail) of the ETSIAAB, in which I participated with the help of my cousin, [Daniel Marcos](https://www.instagram.com/danimarc_06/), who helped me design the wine label, and [Marta PÃ©rez](https://www.instagram.com/chir_ii/), who helped me with the oil label.
