I participated in the [I POSTER COMPETITION](https://www.lenguas.upm.es/2020/12/16/i-concurso-de-carteles/) at UPM's Language Center, whose theme was: "Foreign languages and you: how they have influenced your life". Although I didn't win, I think I got a cute and original poster, which is what I wanted; for another year, I'll check Unsplash better before making decisions ðŸ¤“.

Here is my poster:

{{< figure src="/posts/Imagenes/DondecomienzantusHistorias.jpg" alt="The letters A, Ã‡, O and Ã‘ sit at the table on a red and green checkered picnic blanket. Above them, it reads: 'Language Centre: Where your stories begin'. At the bottom right, a QR to register for courses." >}}
