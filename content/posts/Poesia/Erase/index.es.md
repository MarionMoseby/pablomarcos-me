Este texto, o al menos uno muy parecido, lo escribÃ­ cerca de noviembre de 2015, por eso he puesto esta fecha; sin embargo, la foto es muy posterior, de Villalba en 2020. Curiosamente, lo redactÃ© para prepararme el First Certificate in English, aunque a mi profe no le gustÃ³ mucho que fuera tan dramatic ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Pero no pasa nada, ya estoy mejor :D

Lara saw something unusual in the grass and went back to take a closer look. No, it was nothing. Her sight had treasoned her another time. It was all like that since it all began. First laughter, then tears. First happiness, then a world of fear. She didnt know how everything had happened, but it had.

It all started two years ago, with a boy more beautiful than the world had ever known. With two eyes like stars and a hair like gold, not because of its colour but because of the way it shone. She fell in love, but never knew the reason why; he never loved her, but who cares? She was in the sea, and love was an island there.

And after hundreds and hundreds of stares at the stars; after suffering of love, after suffering so bad, she used a silver knife and got out of the dark.
