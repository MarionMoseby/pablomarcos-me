â€˜Philanthropyâ€™, they say, they who killed my family without an afterthought; â€˜philanthropyâ€™, those who destroy the forests and crush dreams. â€˜Philanthropyâ€™, and a grin, while they mercilessly unleash the rage of the gods.

Some open the Gates, others offer you the Golden Apple of IÃ°unn; both wash their hands in the water theyâ€™ve stolen. But their hands are stained with blood, and the more they wash, the more they poison, the ghost of christmas future hanging over their heads. Thatâ€™s why they give us back the leftovers of their glory â€“ because they know how they gained it, and theyâ€™d hate to live this world with such a debt.
