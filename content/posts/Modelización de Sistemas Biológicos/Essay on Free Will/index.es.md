The existence or not of free will is one of the problems that have most tormented mankind over the centuries, eliciting reactions from fields as varied as psychology, biology and physics.

The field of neurology does not seem to offer conclusive answers to this question. The Lisbet experiment, for example, demonstrated that the actions we take are previously and unconsciously decided by the brain, and that it is then that our consciousness, our "inner voice", feels the desire to perform these actions, thus ruling out the possibility of a thinking entity outside the constraints of the physical world. We must, therefore, go deeper into the matter.

In the field of mathematics, the advent of Conway's Game of Life (GoL) has meant, according to *Wolfram 2002*, "the single most surprising scientific discovery I have ever made". The possibility of simulating terribly complex interactions from a really small set of rules makes us wonder about the very nature of the universe: is it possible that, just as life arose from simple molecules, we could obtain constantly evolving intelligences and thinking beings if we had a large enough GoL? Is it possible, then, that we are nothing more than mere toys of the universe, particles subject to the immutable rules of physics whose path is predefined?

At the beginning of the research conducted for this article, I had the impression, which I think is quite common, that the rules of quantum physics (our universe's equivalent of Conway's rules in the GoL) left, due to their probabilistic nature, a space of hope for free will; however, it is true that this theory is as deterministic as Newtonian physics, and, given that decisions, however difficult to predict, cannot be free if they are enclosed by the laws of probability, this does not seem an interesting path to follow for the defenders of free will.

However, there is still some work to be done in this area, since we do not yet know whether our brain is a decoherent system (i.e. one in which the probabilities of the quantum wave function tend to collapse on a deterministic path) or a chaotic (i.e. unpredictable) one, which would allow us to glimpse, among the randomness of chaos, gaps for free will.

Even more: recent developments, such as *Dennett 2003*, have shown that, even if a system is deterministic, its consequences need not be inevitable: although in the microscopic world particles follow predefined trajectories, in the abstract world in which we humans move, based on concepts, it is possible to avoid the consequences of laws based on such concepts. One can establish, for example, a law such that "in the GoL, Eaters eat Gliders"; or "on planet Earth, lynxes eat rabbits"; however, just as a lynx can stumble and the rabbit escape, a glider can, in certain cases, escape from an Eater, and so can, on occasion, a human being make unexpected decisions of his own, at least in the abstract layer that is the one that really matters to us.

It is because of this (besides, let's not fool ourselves, because of my pre-existing personal convictions) that I prefer to opt for the side that defends the existence of free will, even if not consciously, but internally, because it leaves a free space for our ability to act to improve the world as much as possible. In any case, the debate is still open, as there is no conclusive evidence either way; and while it is impossible to know, at least for the moment, how much space the universe leaves for human action, what we can say with certainty is that our perpetual interest in the subject, which spans multiple disciplines over the centuries, says a lot about our desires as a species.
