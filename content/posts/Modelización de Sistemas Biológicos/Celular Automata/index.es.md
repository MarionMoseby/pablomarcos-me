A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation consisting on a
regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as
on and off. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is
defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state is selected by
assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created according
to some fixed rule that determines the new state of each cell in terms
of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its
neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the
same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the
whole grid simultaneously.

<div class="cell markdown">

The concept was discovered in the 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam and John von
Neumann, and it was popularized in the 80s by John Horton Conway's Game
of Life, a two-dimensional cellular automaton in which all possible
evolutions depend on the initial state

# First task: The elementary cellular automata

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

The first task for this assignment is to use a 1D cellular automata to
analyse the effect of a series of "rules", which are mathematic
functions that determine the new state of each cell in terms of the
current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its
neighborhood. We are presented with the following three rules, which
tell us the new state for the center cell as a function of the current
pattern:

| Rule Number | 111 | 110 | 101 | 100 | 011 | 010 | 001 | 000 | Current Pattern           |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------- |
| 45          | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | New state for center cell |
| 48          | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | New state for center cell |
| 110         | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | New state for center cell |

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

To do this easily, I reused some code found on [this blog
post](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-but-stunning-animated-cellular-automata-in-python-c912e0c156a9)
from Towards Data Science, a magnificent blog I trully and sincerely
recommend. I adapted the code so that it is callable as a function, with
a set of initial conditions that can be specified by the user, and so
that it is more simple, readable and understandable. We start by
importing some necessary modules:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="1">

``` python
import numpy as np                     #Supports common numeric operations
from scipy.signal import convolve2d    #For step updating
from matplotlib import animation       #Creates animations (which we can then display as HTML, gif, etc)   
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt        #For graphs      
from IPython import display            #To display things on Jupyter; in this case, the animations
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

We then define the function that updates the steps in our linear world:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="2">

``` python
def step_linear(x, rule_binary):
    x_shift_right = np.roll(x, 1); x_shift_left = np.roll(x, -1)
    y = np.vstack((x_shift_right, x, x_shift_left)).astype(int) 
    z = np.sum(np.array([[4], [2], [1]]) * y, axis=0).astype(int) 
    return rule_binary[7 - z]
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

And the animation function:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="3">

``` python
def animate_linear(initial_conditions, rule_number, steps = 200, 
                   figtype = "animate", noaxis = True, save = False):
    
    assert 0 <= rule_number <= 255 #The binary rule's format
    
    cell_numb = len(initial_conditions)
    rule_binary_str = np.binary_repr(rule_number, width=8)  #Convert decimal to binary
    rule_binary = np.array([int(ch) for ch in rule_binary_str], dtype=int)
    x = np.zeros((steps, cell_numb), dtype=int)
    x[0, :] = initial_conditions #The first row is the initial conditions vector
    
    for i in range(steps - 1): #Populate the animated matrix
        x[i + 1, :] = step_linear(x[i, :], rule_binary)
        
    global ax; global fig #Make external axis accesible
    if noaxis == True: #Redundant, could remove ''== True'
        fig = plt.figure() #Set axis where we will animate
        ax = plt.axes()
    
    def animate_lin(i):
        ax.clear(); ax.set_axis_off() #Restart for each iteration
        Y = np.zeros((cell_numb, cell_numb), dtype=int) 
        upper_boundary = (i + 1) #Show 1 iteration per frame
        lower_boundary = 0 if upper_boundary <= cell_numb else upper_boundary - cell_numb 
        for t in range(lower_boundary, upper_boundary): 
            Y[t - lower_boundary, :] = x[t, :]
        img = ax.imshow(Y, interpolation='none',cmap='gray_r')
        return [img]
    
    if figtype == "animate":
        anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate_lin, frames=cell_numb, interval=50, blit=True)
        if save == True : anim.save(f'Linear_cell_automata_rule_{rule_number}.gif')
        video = anim.to_html5_video(); html = display.HTML(video)
        display.display(html);
    else:
        animate_lin(steps-1)
        ax.set_title(f"Rule {rule_number}", fontsize=15)
```

And, Â¡that's it\! We now have a simple system that can tell us how a
cellular automaton works in a smart, inrteresting and interactive way.
To further study this system, the enunciado tells us to test 3 different
rules in 5 different scenarios, to see what happens. Lets go\!

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

First, I will try and see what happens if we put "A single black (1)
cell in the middle of the array". To make the data visualization easier
on the eyes, more manageable and more understandable, I will just plot
the static map which shows the full evolution of the cellular automata,
with each rown being a point in time, starting at the top and ending at
the bottom; an animated version can be accessed by changing type to
"animated".

I must say I am **really, really really** proud of this code. It is
simple, customizable, good, made by me (with some help from the internet
of course) and serves a wide variety of use cases\! It really deserves a
good grade :D

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Now, *al meollo*: **can we see repeated patterns? How long does it take
for a pattern to repeat?**. Although this visualization makes it easy
for the human eye to detect $ 2D$ patterns, this is misleading: our
colony is **lineal only**, and pattern repetition should be analyzed
**line by line, not in two dimensions**.

Taking this into account, we can still say that there are some repeated
patterns, which ar the most obvious for **rule 110**. Though not
regular, the colonies of cells that follow this rule seem to follow a
kind of pattern, which, in 2D, ends up looking like stairs and steps
with some isolated boxes in between. Rule 110 has indeed proven to be
[in the boundaries between chaos and
stability](http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/15-1-1.pdf), and might
actually be the smallest nown Turing-complete machine (i.e., one which
is able to recognize or decide on other data-manipulation rule sets).

For **rule 48**, no interesting patterns are observed: just simple lines
of alive cells, maybe like unicellular kelp growing undisturbed on a
lake. For **rule 45**, however, an interesting sort of "pattern"
emmerges, although, just by myself, I cannot be quite sure whether it is
chaotic or just random. Some have suggested, however, that [at least
some periodicy can be found on its
diagonals](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1733073), so this
system might lean more on the chaotic side than on the random one.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

We were also asked to figure out wether the array length influences the
time it takes for a pattern to repeat. To analyze this, I have chosen
rule 110, which seems to exhibit a simple and clearly recognizable
pattern. I have knowingly regenerated the random vector on each
iteration, and chosen the first 25, 50 and 75 values, with the full 100
values availaible in the last point.

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="8">

``` python
initial_conditions = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100,), p=[0.1, 0.9])
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 30))
ax = fig.add_subplot(131)
animate_linear(initial_conditions[0:25], 110, figtype = "static", noaxis = False)
ax.set_title("Rule 110 with 25 random initial values", fontsize=15);
initial_conditions = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100,), p=[0.1, 0.9])
ax = fig.add_subplot(132)
animate_linear(initial_conditions[0:50], 110, figtype = "static", noaxis = False)
ax.set_title("Rule 110 with 50 random initial values", fontsize=15);
initial_conditions = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100,), p=[0.1, 0.9])
ax = fig.add_subplot(133)
animate_linear(initial_conditions[0:75], 110, figtype = "static", noaxis = False)
ax.set_title("Rule 110 with 75 random initial values", fontsize=15);
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

The squared design I have chosen for my grids means that, the smaller
the number of cells, the less resolution there is; but, to be honest,
there is no need for more: we can already see that, **no matter the
length of the initial conditions array**, the pattern starts appearing
almost inmediately, without delay, and regardless of the size of the
initial array. This reminds me of fractals, although I am clearly not an
expert on the matter.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

The last question tells us to cathegorize our three cellular automatas
(the ones that stem from our three rules) using Wolfram's classification
([Â¡created by the guy behind wolfram alpha\!\!
UwU](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/)),
which creates 4 classes, starting from a random initial state:

1.  Evolution leads to a homogeneous state.
2.  Evolution leads to a set of separated simple stable or periodic
    structures.
3.  Evolution leads to a chaotic pattern.
4.  Evolution leads to complex localized structures, sometimes
    long-lived.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

I would say the first structures, those generated by **rule 45**, belong
to **the third wolfram class**; the pattern seems to be completely
chaotic, and, although some laberyth-like structures do seem to appear,
I dont believe one can count them as non-random.

Talking about **rule 110**, I would say the patterns it creates belong
to **the fourth class**, since it seems to lead to complex structures
that propagate locally in the lattice. In fact, as we have already
discussed, rule 110 has found to be one of the smallest turing-complete
machines ever discovered, and it is of great interest to Cellular
Automata

With regards to **rule 48**, I would say it belongs to **the second
class**, as we can see those "fine lines" of development surrounded by a
sea of nothing, which, by the way, remind me of the growing of very
simple kelp on the sea.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

One interesting take-home message might be that the really important
part here is, in fact, the rule, and not the initial conditions: no
matter how much we have tried to change those, the pattern ends up
conforming to a given shape.

# Second task: The game of life

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

The second task for this assignment is to generate our own cellular
automata from scratch using python, and see how it evolves depending on
the original conditions. For this assignment, I will use a modified
version of the code found in [the pythonic preambulations
blog](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/conways-game-of-life/),
which I updated to make it compatible with python3 and to account for
some libraries' deprecations; if you prefer a pre-packaged solution, you
could use [cellypylib](https://github.com/lantunes/cellpylib) instead (
`pip install cellpylib` ). I know this is not as fancy as could be, and
I know it does not expand on Conway's inital GoL concept, but, to be
quite honest, this was already too difficult for me to accomplish and I
belive it to be the most I am capable of.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

First, we have to define the function that automates each step in the
cellular automaton's evolution. Here, we are using scipy's convolute2d
method, which applies a filter (also known as a kernel) to a given
matrix. In this case, we are using a matrix of 3x3 all-ones, which means
that all neighbor's states are taken into account (in a square grid) and
params wrap and same, which ensure that the output is the same size as
the original matrix and that the boundary is treated as the one
surrounding each cell. We then return 1 (alive) for any cell surrounded
by exactly 3 living cells and for any living cell surrounded by exactly
2 living cells. For the rest, 0 (dead) is returned, following the
principles initially described in [Conway's original
paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf).

This, in my opinion, is a quite simple and elegant solution to
implementing the GoL model in python; if you wish for a more manual
solution, the original code provides an alternative "life\_step\_1"
function, which uses nothing but numpy.

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="9">

``` python
def life_step(X):
    nbrs_count = convolve2d(X, np.ones((3, 3)), mode='same', boundary='wrap') - X
    return (nbrs_count == 3) | (X & (nbrs_count == 2))
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Now, we can define the axis where we will animate the plotting function:
it has an init, that sets the background, and an animate object, that
sets the steps of the animations. I have found 200 frames and an speed
of 30 to be enough for an interesting movie, and I have chosen
`anim.to_html5_video()` because it didnt produce an empty plot, as
`HTML(anim.to_jshtml())` does (thanks
[BindiChen](https://github.com/BindiChen/machine-learning/blob/master/data-visualization/0001-matplotlib-animation/matplotlib-animation-notebook.ipynb)).
Thus:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="10">

``` python
def animate_GoL(initial_conditions, frames = 200, speed = 30, dpi = 10, save = False):
    X = np.asarray(initial_conditions).astype(bool)
    X_blank = np.zeros_like(X)
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(30, 40), dpi=dpi)
    ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1], xticks=[], yticks=[], frameon=False)
    im = ax.imshow(X, cmap=plt.cm.binary, interpolation='nearest')
    im.set_clim(-0.05, 1) 
    
    def init(): #This plots the background of each frame
        im.set_data(X_blank)
        return (im,)

    def animate(i): #This generates each frame
        im.set_data(animate.X)
        animate.X = life_step(animate.X)
        return (im,)

    animate.X = X
    anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, init_func=init,frames=frames, interval=speed)
    if save == True : anim.save('game_of_life.gif', writer='imagemagick') 
    
    video = anim.to_html5_video(); html = display.HTML(video)
    display.display(html); plt.close()
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Lets give it a test run\!

**Note:** To get the full experience, please use the provided Jupyter

visualizing only, and, because of its static nature, it cannot match the
quality of the animated data representations themselves.

Here, we can see some **periodic patterns**, such as the penta-decathlon
(period 15), the pulsar (period 3) or the beacon (period 2); as well as
some **static patterns**, such as the beehive and the boat. There is
also one **spaceship**, a periodic pattern that moves over space; and
some **temporary patterns**, one of which evolves toward a period-two
ocilator which ends up killing our bird-like spaceship over time, slowly
spanding and breaking havoc through the entire board. That is the beauty
of the game of life: both really complex and really simple patterns can
emmerge from a series of initial patterns, simulating the complexity of
real, live systems with predictable and mathematical rules.

And, finally, as a quirck, Â¡we can re-geneate the image at the start of
this paper by hand\! Just define some initial conditions:

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="14">

``` python
init = np.zeros((45, 70), dtype=int)
init[0,24] = 1; 
init[1,22] = 1; init[1,24] = 1
init[2,12] = 1; init[2,13] = 1; init[2,20] = 1; init[2,21] = 1; init[2,34] = 1; init[2,35] = 1
init[3,11] = 1; init[3,15] = 1; init[3,20] = 1; init[3,21] = 1; init[3,34] = 1; init[3,35] = 1
init[4,0]  = 1; init[4,1]  = 1; init[4,10] = 1; init[4,16] = 1; init[4,20] = 1; init[4,21] = 1

Here, we can see a gun, is a pattern with a main part that repeats
periodically, like an oscillator, and that also periodically emits
spaceships. I believe this represents an interesting illustration as to
how reproducible this game is. [More patterns can be found
here](https://conwaylife.appspot.com/library).

If I, personally, were to design my own "Game of Life"-inspired cellular
automaton, I would probably try to do something to implement the SEIRCM
model explained in Lesson 2's exercises: it would thus have 6 different
states:

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

  - S: susceptible to contracting the disease
  - E: exposed to infected individuals, incubate the disease but are not
    yet contagious.
  - I: infected, spread the disease
  - R: have overcome the disease, do not spread the virus and have
    developed immunity to it.
  - C: infected individuals requiring intensive care.
  - M: deceased by COVID-19

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

With the transitions between this states being determined by the
following equations:

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

\\begin{align*} \\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\\beta:I:\\frac{S}{N}\\
\\frac{dE}{dt} &= \\beta:I:\\frac{S}{N} - \\delta E\\ \\frac{dI}{dt} &=
\\delta:E - (1-a):\\gamma:I - \\eta:a:I\\ \\frac{dH}{dt} &=
\\eta:(1-a):I-\\tau:(1-u):H - u:\\sigma:H\\ \\frac{dC}{dt} &=
u:\\sigma:H - m:\\rho:min(UCI, C) - max(0, C-UCI) -
\\omega:(1-m):min(UCI,C)\\ \\frac{dR}{dt} &= \\gamma:(1-a):I +
\\tau:(1-u):H + \\omega:(1-m):min(UCI,C)\\ \\frac{dM}{dt} &=
m:\\rho:min(UCI, C) + max(0, C-UCI)\\ \\end{align*}

If I were to choose, I would select for an hexagonal grid, instead of an
squared one, given that it has both translational and rotational
symetry, and, due to its higer number of neighbours, that it more
accurately represents the high-interconnectedness that exists in today's
world, specially in Spain, which was the subject of the analysis in
Exercise 2. Also, [hexagons are the
bestagons\!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY) :D

The model would, of course, present no randomness, since virus
transmision has clear causality, and would be only in 2D, since adding a
third dimmension seems like too much of a distraction with little return
on investment: we humans do live in a 3D world, but most of our
interactions take place at ground level, except maybe when we are in la
luna de valencia.

The existence or not of free will is one of the problems that have most
tormented mankind over the centuries, eliciting reactions from fields as
varied as psychology, biology and physics.

The field of neurology does not seem to offer conclusive answers to this
question. The Lisbet experiment, for example, demonstrated that the
actions we take are previously and unconsciously decided by the brain,
and that it is then that our consciousness, our "inner voice", feels the
desire to perform these actions, thus ruling out the possibility of a
thinking entity outside the constraints of the physical world. We must,
therefore, go deeper into the matter.

In the field of mathematics, the advent of Conway's Game of Life (GoL)
has meant, according to *Wolfram 2002*, "the single most surprising
scientific discovery I have ever made". The possibility of simulating
terribly complex interactions from a really small set of rules makes us
wonder about the very nature of the universe: is it possible that, just
as life arose from simple molecules, we could obtain constantly evolving
intelligences and thinking beings if we had a large enough GoL? Is it
possible, then, that we are nothing more than mere toys of the universe,
particles subject to the immutable rules of physics whose path is
predefined?

At the beginning of the research conducted for this article, I had the
impression, which I think is quite common, that the rules of quantum
physics (our universe's equivalent of Conway's rules in the GoL) left,
due to their probabilistic nature, a space of hope for free will;
however, it is true that this theory is as deterministic as Newtonian
physics, and, given that decisions, however difficult to predict, cannot
be free if they are enclosed by the laws of probability, this does not
seem an interesting path to follow for the defenders of free will.

However, there is still some work to be done in this area, since we do
not yet know whether our brain is a decoherent system (i.e. one in which
the probabilities of the quantum wave function tend to collapse on a
deterministic path) or a chaotic (i.e. unpredictable) one, which would
allow us to glimpse, among the randomness of chaos, gaps for free will.

Even more: recent developments, such as *Dennett 2003*, have shown that,
even if a system is deterministic, its consequences need not be
inevitable: although in the microscopic world particles follow
predefined trajectories, in the abstract world in which we humans move,
based on concepts, it is possible to avoid the consequences of laws
based on such concepts. One can establish, for example, a law such that
"in the GoL, Eaters eat Gliders"; or "on planet Earth, lynxes eat
rabbits"; however, just as a lynx can stumble and the rabbit escape, a
glider can, in certain cases, escape from an Eater, and so can, on
occasion, a human being make unexpected decisions of his own, at least
in the abstract layer that is the one that really matters to us.

It is because of this (besides, let's not fool ourselves, because of my
pre-existing personal convictions) that I prefer to opt for the side
that defends the existence of free will, even if not consciously, but
internally, because it leaves a free space for our ability to act to
improve the world as much as possible. In any case, the debate is still
open, as there is no conclusive evidence either way; and while it is
impossible to know, at least for the moment, how much space the universe
leaves for human action, what we can say with certainty is that our
perpetual interest in the subject, which spans multiple disciplines over
the centuries, says a lot about our desires as a species.
