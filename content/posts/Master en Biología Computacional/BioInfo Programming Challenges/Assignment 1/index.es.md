Your task is to use Object-oriented programming to achieve two things:

1) "Simulate" planting 7 grams of seeds from each of the records in the seed stock genebank; then, you should update the genebank information to show the new quantity of seeds that remain after a planting. The new state of the genebank should be printed to a new file, using exactly the same format as the original file seed_stock_data.tsv. If the amount of seed is reduced to zero or less than zero, then a friendly warning message should appear on the screen. The amount of seed left in the gene bank is, of course, not LESS than zero gui√±o


2) Process the information in cross_data.tsv and determine which genes are genetically-linked. To achieve this, you will have to do a Chi-square test on the F2 cross data. If you discover genes that are linked, this information should be added as a property of each of the genes (they are both linked to each other).

To run the script, use: ```ruby process_database.rb  ./SampleData/gene_information.tsv  ./SampleData/seed_stock_data.tsv ./SampleData/cross_data.tsv  new_stock_file.tsv```
