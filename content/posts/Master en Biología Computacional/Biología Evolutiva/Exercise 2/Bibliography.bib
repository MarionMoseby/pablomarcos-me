	abstract = {The family Rhabdoviridae has a non-segmented single stranded negative-sense RNA and its genome ranges in size from approximately 11 kb to almost 16 kb. It is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses with members infecting a wide range of organisms. The five structural protein genes are arranged in the same linear order (3'-N-P-M-G-L-5') and may be interspersed with one more additional accessory gene. For many years, a full of knowledge of the rhabdoviridae has been established on extensive studies of two kinds of prototype viruses; vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus (RABV). Among them, the genus Lyssavirus includes RABV and rabies-related viruses naturally infect mammals and chiropterans via bite-exposure by rabid animals and finally cause fatal encephalitis. In this review, we describe the sketch of the various virological features of the Rhabdoviridae, especially focusing on VSV and RABV.},

The tools and concepts currently available to control rabies were developed at the end of the 19th Century, including the first live, attenuated vaccine ever developed for humans and the first post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen. No progress, however, has been made in etiological treatment, leaving clinicians who provide care to animals or patients with symptomatic rabies as powerless today as their colleagues in Mesopotamia, 40 centuries ago. Rabies remains to date the most lethal infectious disease known to humans. Widespread access to timely, effective, and affordable PEP in rural areas of developing countries is urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Rabies is a life-threatening neglected tropical disease: tens of thousands of cases are reported annually in endemic countries (mainly in Africa and Asia), although the actual numbers are most likely underestimated. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that is caused by infection with viruses of the Lyssavirus genus, which are transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal. Dogs are the most important reservoir for rabies viruses, and dog bites account for {\textgreater}99\% of human cases. The virus first infects peripheral motor neurons, and symptoms occur after the virus reaches the central nervous system. Once clinical disease develops, it is almost certainly fatal. Primary prevention involves dog vaccination campaigns to reduce the virus reservoir. If exposure occurs, timely post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent the progression to clinical disease and involves appropriate wound care, the administration of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccination. A multifaceted approach for human rabies eradication that involves government support, disease awareness, vaccination of at-risk human populations and, most importantly, dog rabies control is necessary to achieve the WHO goal of reducing the number of cases of dog-mediated human rabies to zero by 2030.},

This exchange has profound effects on the nature and rapidity of virus and host evolution. Recombination between dsDNA viruses is common, as is genetic exchange between dsDNA viruses or retroviruses and host genomes. Recombination between RNA virus genomes is also well known. In contrast, genetic exchange across viral kingdoms, for instance between nonretroviral RNA viruses or ssDNA viruses and host genomes or between RNA and DNA viruses, was previously thought to be practically nonexistent. However, there is now growing evidence for both RNA and ssDNA viruses recombining with host dsDNA genomes and, more surprisingly, RNA virus genes recombining with ssDNA virus genomes. Mechanisms are still unclear, but this deep recombination greatly expands the breadth of virus evolution and confounds virus taxonomy.},

	volume = {86},
	issn = {0022-1317},
	doi = {10.1099/vir.0.80710-0},
	abstract = {Throughout North America, rabies virus (RV) is endemic in bats. Distinct RV variants exist that are closely associated with infection of individual host species, such that there is little or no sustained spillover infection away from the primary host. Using Bayesian methodology, nucleotide substitution rates were estimated from alignments of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences of nine distinct bat RV variants from North America. Substitution rates ranged from 2.32 x 10(-4) to 1.38 x 10(-3) substitutions per site per year. A maximum-likelihood (ML) molecular clock model was rejected for only two of the nine datasets. In addition, using sequences from bat RV variants across the Americas, the evolutionary rate for the complete N gene was estimated to be 2.32 x 10(-4). This rate was used to scale trees using Bayesian and ML methods, and the time of the most recent common ancestor for current bat RV variant diversity in the Americas was estimated to be 1660 (range 1267-1782) and 1651 (range 1254-1773), respectively. Our reconstructions suggest that RV variants currently associated with infection of bats from Latin America (Desmodus and Tadarida) share the earliest common ancestor with the progenitor RV. In addition, from the ML tree, times were estimated for the emergence of the three major lineages responsible for bat rabies cases in North America. Adaptation to infection of the colonial bat species analysed (Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis spp.) appears to have occurred much quicker than for the solitary species analysed (Lasionycteris noctivagans, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus cinereus), suggesting that the process of virus adaptation may be dependent on host biology.},

	issn = {1567-1348},
	doi = {10.1016/j.meegid.2008.08.003},
	abstract = {The previous study of the evolutionary rates of European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) used a strict molecular clock to estimate substitution rates of the nucleoprotein gene and in turn times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the entire genotype and the two major EBLV-1 lineages (EBLV-1A and EBLV-1B). The results of that study suggested that the evolutionary rate of EBLV-1 was one of the lowest recorded for RNA viruses and that genetic diversity of EBLV-1 arose 500-750 years ago. Here I have shown that the use of a relaxed molecular clock (allowing branch rates to vary within a phylogeny) shows that these previous estimates should be revised. The relaxed clock provides a significantly better fit to all datasets. The substitution rate of EBLV-1B is compatible to that expected given previous estimates for the N gene of rabies virus whilst rate estimations for EBLV-1A appear to be confounded by substantial rate variation within the phylogeny. The relaxed clock substitution rate for EBLV-1 (1.1 x 10(-4)) is higher than had been estimated previously, and closer to that expected for the N gene. Moreover, tMRCA estimates for EBLV-1 are substantially reduced using the relaxed molecular clock (70-300 years) although the differing dynamics of EBLV-1A and EBLV-1B confound the confidence in this estimate. Current diversity of both EBLV-1A and EBLV-1B appears to have emerged within the last 100 years. Reconstruction of the population histories suggests that EBLV-1B may be emerging whilst the signal derived from the EBLV-1A phylogeny may be dampened by clade-specific dynamics.},

	abstract = {To establish the phylogeographic relationships in rabies viruses in Brazil, we studied a dataset retrieved from GenBank consisting of 71 genetic sequences from the coding region of the N gene of rabies viruses isolated in dogs over a period of 22 years. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method available in the BEAST package was used with the GTR+G+Г4 evolutionary model in conjunction with the relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model and an exponential growth tree prior. A discrete phylogeographic diffusion model was also analyzed using a standard continuous-time Markov chain viewed with Google Earth to provide a spatial projection of the diffusion of genetic lineages based on their phylogeographic relationships. The topology of the time and substitution phylogenetic trees agreed with the spatial dispersal of the lineages. It was possible to infer that the lineages in the southeastern region of Brazil in the 1970s are the closest to the most common recent ancestor and that all the lineages in the midwestern, northern and northeastern regions are more distant. The importance of this study lies in the fact that it can help with the planning of rabies control measures, as dogs continue to be the main reservoir of rabies virus throughout the world.},
