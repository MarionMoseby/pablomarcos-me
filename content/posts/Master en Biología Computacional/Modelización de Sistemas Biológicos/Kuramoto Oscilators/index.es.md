The Kuramoto Model is a mathematical model used to describe the
synchronization of a large set of coupled oscillators. This formulation,
which was motivated by the behaviour of both physical and biological
oscilators, has found widespread application in neuroscience.

The model makes several assumptions, including that there is weak
coupling, that the oscillators are identical or nearly identical, and
that interactions depend sinusoidally on the phase difference between
each pair of objects.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

For the exercises, we need to simulate some kuramoto oscilators coupled
using an external forcing: for one of the systems, this external forcing
will be the average phase of all the oscilators, while, for the other,
we will be using a uniform distribution between 0 and $2 \cdot \pi$.
Thus:

This code, which has been adapted from [a course by Rochester
University](astro.pas.rochester.edu/~aquillen/phy256/problems/ps5+sol.html),
implements the two methods we have been asked to implement and can work
with a number of N oscilators. Now, we would like to study the
syncronization transition through order parameter $r$ as $K$ varies
in the two ensembles. To do this, we first calculate r for a range of
100 values of k between 0 and 10.

As we can see, the system coupled by average internal phase experiences
pretty fast syncronization, almost too fast to bee seen on the graph
(hum\! suspicious... something might be wrong?). For the systems that
reach complete syncronization, that happens after only 2 to 3
oscilations, while the ones that reach partial sync take a bit more to
reach their maximum r, with that r being clearly dependent on K (as one
can see with the gradient) It should also be noted that the values of K
tested (between 0 and 0.07) are quite, quite low, so we can say this
system is **highly sensible to coupling**. Looking at the legends, the
transition to partial syncronization (total syncronization is more
difficult to study as previously explained) seems to occur after about 5
repetitions for k = 0.04; or after 15 rounds for k = 0.02

The system coupled using a random distribution, however, never reaches a
point where it becames stable; and this makes sense\! By applying a
random external force in each oscilation, we are just "driving the
system crazy", making it impossible for it to reach a steady state.
Thus, we will try to apply a more "coherent" external force, one which
will act as a "master ocilator" that helps all oscilators syncronize; in
this case, this forces will be $\pi$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$

As we can see, both graphs are pretty simmilar: They have some complete
coupling, some partial coupling and some random noise (no coupling at
all). When compared with the previous graph, we can see than, unline
with external random force, coupling does appear; but, the coupling is
always less intense (there is less lines in the upper part of the graph)
than when using $\Psi$ as the coupling method. Thus, it can be said
that **interal average phase is a better coupling method than an
external forcing**

Once again, the color gradient clearly shows how higher k values lead to
higher r values (makes sense)

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Now, we would like to plot the distribution of phase differences between
all pairs of oscillators for different values of K, before and after the
transition. To do this, we obtain the values from get\_new\_theta
function. We use k = 0.05, and 5 vs 20 rounds of change:

(To avoid repeating work, I will do this for Average Phase Coupling
only)

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

First, we set the plotting function and the initial (must be common)
values for plotting:

``` python
theta = 2*np.pi*np.random.random(100); omega = 2*np.pi*np.random.random(100)
```

``` python
def plot_phase_diffs(k, numosc):
    r, new_theta, osc = do_nsteps(theta,omega,k,0.1,numosc,"oscilators") #Get things to plot

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.xlabel('Oscilators', fontsize=15)
    plt.ylabel('Phase', fontsize=15)
    plt.title(f'Phase of oscilators for k = {k} & {numosc} oscilations', fontsize=18)

    plt.ylabel('Phase difference', fontsize=15)
    plt.title(f'Phase difference for k = {k} & {numosc} oscilations', fontsize=18)
    plt.hist(osc[-1], color="#0000ff");
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

And then, we plot:

``` python
plot_phase_diffs(0.05, 5)

As we can see, after 5 oscilations, most oscilators stand completely
separated and different. Lets see after 20:

Wow\! As we can see, the oscilators have converged clearly: The
histogram shows a distribution much more centered than the previous one:
this is also visible at the left, where oscilators now seem much more
"aligned\!" (its bad for me to say it, but it is definetely an amazing
data visualization hum)

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Finally, we would like to vary $\omega$ and $K$ to stimate where the
arnold tongues are situated. Lets have a quick recap: arnold tongues
are, essentially, **areas of entrainment**, that is, the regions where
the oscilators tend to syncronize with each other. We can approximate
arnold tongues by using the order parameter $r$, given that, the
higher the r, the more syncronized; another, more accurate way of doing
it would be by plotting the same heatmap but with a comparison of the
oscillator frequencies $\theta$ and the external forcing $\Omega$.
To do this, we can define the following plotting function:

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="10">

``` python
theta = 2*np.pi*np.random.random(100); omega = 2*np.pi*np.random.random(100) #Reset initial values
```

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="11">

``` python
def plot_heatmap(mymethod):
    my_omegas = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, 25); my_ks = np.linspace(0,0.07,36)
    omega_axis = np.around(my_omegas, 2); k_axis = np.around(my_ks, 2)
    r_matrix = pd.DataFrame(index=my_ks, columns=my_omegas)
    for omega in my_omegas:
        for k in np.linspace(0,0.07,36):
            r, new_theta, osc = do_nsteps(theta,omega,k,0.1,10,mymethod) 
            r_matrix.at[k,omega] = round(r[-1], 4) #Append r after n oscillations (n-1 actually)
    sns.heatmap(r_matrix.to_numpy().tolist(), 
                cmap = "viridis", xticklabels = omega_axis, yticklabels = k_axis)
    if isinstance(mymethod, float):
        plt.title(f'Heatmap of $r$ with $\Omega$ = {round(mymethod, 2)}', fontsize=18) 
    else:
        plt.title(f'Heatmap of $r$ with {mymethod} coupling', fontsize=18)
    plt.xlabel('External forcing $\omega$', fontsize=15)
    plt.ylabel('Coupling coefficient $k$', fontsize=15)
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

And plot it:

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plot_heatmap("average")

In the 4 graphs plotted above, we can see the following:

  - The average-phase coupled map presents arnold tongues for all k \<
    0.03 (approximately). Of course, $\omega$ does nothing here: this
    map is not coupled by external force, but just by average phase\!\!
  - The randomly-coupled map has a completely random, pixelated
    behaviour: we cannot find **any** arnold tongues (or any pattern
    really)
  - For both of the externally coupled maps, arnold tongues are found,
    and in a pretty simmilar way: the higher the k, the more likely the
    oscilators will be coupled. However, with regards to omega, there
    seems to be a treshold around $2 \cdot \pi$, after which no
    coupling is found; in fact, there seems to be a point of "maximum
    disorder" around $3 \cdot \pi$, after which syncronization seems
    to get a bit better, probably doe to random syncronizations (noise)

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

And, Â¡that would mostly be it\! As a bonus, if you wish, there is a way
to plot a dynamic phase map, Â¡just as in [Ride my
Kuramotorcicle](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/slides/ride-my-kuramotocycle/)\!
using the same code from [Rochester
University](astro.pas.rochester.edu/~aquillen/phy256/problems/ps5+sol.html).
Please, refer to their course for full details.

As a closing note, one way to improve the code in this Jupyter Notebook
would be to rename the `theta` and `omega` vectors, which currently have
to be updated anytime a function is called, to avoid conflict; however,
I didnt have enough time for that :(
