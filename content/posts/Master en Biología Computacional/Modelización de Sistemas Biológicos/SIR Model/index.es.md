A basic SIR model, such as the one that we will now proceed to study,
includes three cathegories:

  - Susceptibles: The individuals that may be infected
  - Infected: The individuals currently carrying the virus, which can
    pass it on to the next generation
  - Recovered: Those that have been infected, have recovered, and cannot
    pass on the infection (this model assumes permanent inmunity)

Which relate among them using the following parameters:

  - $\beta$: number of infected persons per sick individual per day.
  - $\mu$: 1/period of infection. This is the rate at which infected
    individuals recover.

Thus, we get the following set of equations that define the model:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta S I \qquad \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \mu I \qquad \frac{dR}{dt} = \mu I$$

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

As we can see, the system does not explicitly reference time, and rather
works indirectly with the variation in the population of the different
epidemiological groups. Given that $\mu$ is defined as the time an
individual takes to recover, we can define the parameter
$\tau = \mu^{-1}$ as the average time an individual remains infected.
To set an epidemic treshold, we can use $R_{0}$, a [tried and tested
parameter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25365599/) defined as:

$$R_{0} = \frac{\beta \cdot S_{0}}{\mu}$$

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Here, if $R_{0}$ \> 1, the infection propagates, growing
exponentially; if, however, $R_{0}$ \< 1, the infection progressively
deflates, ending eventually. In this model, the longer an individual
spends Infected ($\uparrow \tau$, and thus $\downarrow \mu$), the
higher the $R_{0}$, and, thus, the more contagious the infection is.
For $\beta$, the effect is the opposite: the more individuals one is
able to infect, the more contagious the disease gets.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

To understand the effecfts of the initial conditions, we can use the
plane phase:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="1">

``` python
#Imports module
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="2">

``` python
def plane_phase(b, u):
    S, I = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0,10,1), np.arange(0,10,1))
    f = -b*S*I
    g = b*S*I-u*I
    plt.quiver(S,I,f,g)
    plt.title('Quiver graph for Œ≤ = {0} & u = {1}'.format(b, u))
    plt.xlabel('Susceptible')
    plt.ylabel('Infected')
```

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

We can plot it for different parameter values that generate an $R_{0}$
above the epidemic value of 1:

</div>

<div class="cell code" data-execution_count="3">

``` python
plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plane_phase(100, 1)
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plane_phase(5, 4)
plt.show()
```

<div class="output display_data">

</div>

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

As we can see, despite the different set values, if $R_{0}$ \> 1, the
infected population grows quickly, making the susceptible population
decrease as fast (since N = I + S + R = constant). If, however, we
select values which get us to an $R_{0}$ \< 1, we get an increasingly
smaller infected population, with susceptibles decreasing or even
staying the same as the epidemic extinguishes so fastly it cannot even
turn Susceptibles to Infected an Recovered at a rate big enough to show
in the graph. As we can see in the last example, values of $\beta$ = 1
and $\mu$ = 1 do not necessarily produce neither $R_{0}$ = 1 (as it
is also dependent on $S_{0}$) nor stability (as will be discussed
below).

With regards to stability, we can mathematically analyze the system.
Since the population, N, remains constant (as the model ignores new
births and deaths), we can skip the Recovered class in order to
understand how the system behaves (See "Mathematical Models in Biology,
by Leah Edelstein, page 247): it would be simply equivalent to saying
that all Recovered patients go outside the scope of the model, since,
assuming they are inmune,they can no longer go back to any other
compartiment, and stop being of interest to us.

As we can see, the model has no solution, no steady states and no points
where the population of Infected and Susceptible individuals remain
unchanged. This makes sense: the model assumes a constant population N =
I + S + R, and with S only able to decrease and R only able to increase,
as new births and deaths are not accounted for. This result is
consistent with what we found when playing with the plane phase: there
are no points of stability, only inevitable derive towards extinction or
full infection and recovery

individuals, can be graphically plotted as:

In **Figure A**, we see that the maximum ratio of infections is reached
after about 12 days; we can modify this to fit a different, more
contagious epidemic, such as in **Figure B**. As we can see, in this
crazy scenario, the peak is reached really abruptly, since the infection
is incredibly contagious. The peak of infected individuals is reached
afyer only 3 days, and, after 12 days, all the population (N=1000) is
recovered (since this model does not account for deaths). With a more
mild disease, the infected curve can be less and less steep, making the
epidemic last longer, but probably overcharging the sanitary system
less: see **Figure C**. We can even have a disease so mild it fails to
infect all the population\! In **Figure D**, a form of "herd immunity"
is reached after 30 days.

We can also use this to confirm there are no endemic states when
variating the initial conditions:

As can be seen, the system behaves the same, changing the initial
conditions is equivalent to moving the start of the epidemic over the
"days" axis

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

Finally, we can fix **both** the initial conditions **and** the value of
the epidemic threshold, and change $\beta$ and $\mu$, such that we
can better understand the qualitative role of such parameters. If we
fix, say, $R_{0}$ = 1.5, $S_{0}$ = 999 and $I_{0}$ = 1, all
possible combinations of $\beta$ and $\mu$ might given by
$\beta = \mu \cdot 1.5015$. Thus:

Here, we can see that, despite keeping $R_{0}$ stable, the widely
different combinations of $\beta$ and $\mu$ produce quite different
results; after all, it is $\beta$ and $\mu$ that define the
evolution of the epidemic, with $R_{0}$ only an indirect way to know
wether the population will keep rising or not; here, since $R_{0}$ was
not that big (only 1.5) and the population was quite small (only 1000
individuals) the herd inmunity treshold is easy to reach. Nonetheless,
despite the big visual differences among the graphs, we can see that all
of them show quite similar evolutions, only with different time scales;
thus, $R_{0}$ remains an interesting estimator of the general
evolution of an epidemic.

With regards to the **qualitative role of the parameters**, $\beta$
represents the number of infected persons per sick individual per day,
and $\mu$ the rate at which infected individuals recover. The bigger
the first and the smallest the second, the more agressive the epidemic
is.
