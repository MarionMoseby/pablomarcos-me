To any UPM's Master in Computational Biology students that might be reading this, i have a **strong warning** to make:


{{< alert type="danger" >}}
DO. NOT. PICK. THIS. SUBJECT. !!!!!!!
{{< /alert >}}

The teacher was *extremely rude* to the students, to the point that, after being publicly humiliated, I decided to change it for "Evolutiva", which I found much, much nicer. I have found absolutely no one from my promotion (2021/22) that can recommend this teacher, although the subject's contents are, in fact, interesting. Thus, in case you decide to make the error of taking his course, I have uploaded all the assignments to make your life easier, although I am sure he will not be happy if he finds out I have done so (which delights me in a way ðŸ˜‹).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I didn't get good grades in his assignments, so proceed with care!
