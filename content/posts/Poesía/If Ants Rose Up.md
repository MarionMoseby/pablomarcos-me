If ants rose up, they would take over your room. They would march like silent sentinels, through their hidden passages and their obscure tunnels, down into the deepest realms of yourself.

If ants rose up, there'd be no windows or doors to shut; no chains, no pains, no frosts and no repellents; there'd be grains, and seeds, and those who opposed them would be at their knees.

The ants that queue playfully in your room, the ones that you find just searching for food; the queens, and the workers, and the males too: they are all secretely plotting your doom.

If ants rose up they'd be no way to stop them; they'd go unencumbered from  the coach to the kitchen, and they'd finally have a way to fend for themselves. But hear me my friend, because there is something you must hear: there is a tiny little ant beating inside your chest.
