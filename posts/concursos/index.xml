Okular is a multifaceted program that I use almost every day for my PDF reading and annotating needs, although it can do much more. Sadly, its website was a bit outdated and not mobile friendly. I thus proposed to rewrite the Okular website using the HUGO framework, in a similar way as was done with the kde.org main website, and keeping consistency with other KDE applications such as Konsole.</description></item><item><title>SoK 2021 April Report</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-april/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 14:45:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-april/</guid><description>All work on the project was finished in march, so all that is left is some minor modifications and writing the project report. I believe that the goals set at the start of the project have been mostly fulfilled: the project does in fact present the information in a clear and beautiful, mobile-friendly way, thanks to the aether-sass theme. It has google-independent search, although it does not use lunar.js as was suggested, and the development news are now in its own section, although the changelogs were left outside of the individual posts for practicality reasons.</description></item><item><title>SoK 2021 March Report</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-march/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 19:40:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-march/</guid><description>In the february post, I mentioned how I ordered the material that was on Carl Schwan&amp;rsquo;s MVP for the Index page, explaining Okular&amp;rsquo;s main features. Now that that was set, I had to add support for i18n, as it can be difficult for translators to work with a raw html template. This was achieved by using the {{i18n}} HUGO template, which specifies the translatable parts by using {{ i18n &amp;quot;Section.variable&amp;quot; }} in each of the strings to translate, and then mapping the values into a yaml file such as:</description></item><item><title>SoK 2021 February Report</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-february/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/season-of-kde-2021/sok-report-february/</guid><description>I started the month by porting the Anouncements section from Raw HTML to Markdown, for which I wrote a small python script that parses all the content in this news.rdf file, inherited from the old site, and creates several markdown post files that will be processed by the list and single templates of the aether-sass theme into the new section.

I did, however, find time to write the project application, which I have attached below for reference, and I spent what little time I was able to devote to SoK learning how to properly use HUGO and which templates I had to edit to get a given, desired result.</description></item><item><title>UPM Language Center Poster Contest</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/centrodelenguas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/concursos/centrodelenguas/</guid><description>I participated in the I POSTER COMPETITION at UPM&amp;rsquo;s Language Center, whose theme was: &amp;ldquo;Foreign languages and you: how they have influenced your life&amp;rdquo;.
