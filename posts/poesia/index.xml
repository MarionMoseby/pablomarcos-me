I sometimes feel like a rock, standing high and standing tall, fighting against all odds.
I sometimes feel like a mountain, big, old, and sometimes even broken.
I feel alone most often.
But like a rock and like a tree, like a mountain and the sea, this too shall pass. I too shall understand, once the healing breeze of time lets the first grey hairs settle on my forehead, that all of this was not in vain.</description></item><item><title>If ants rose up</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/poesia/if-ants-rose-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/poesia/if-ants-rose-up/</guid><description>If ants rose up, they would take over your room. They would march like silent sentinels, through their hidden passages and their obscure tunnels, down into the deepest realms of yourself.
If ants rose up, there&amp;rsquo;d be no windows or doors to shut; no chains, no pains, no frosts and no repellents; there&amp;rsquo;d be grains, and seeds, and those who opposed them would be at their knees.

Some open the Gates, others offer you the Golden Apple of IÃ°unn; both wash their hands in the water theyâ€™ve stolen. But their hands are stained with blood, and the more they wash, the more they poison, the ghost of christmas future hanging over their heads.</description></item><item><title>Escape</title><link>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/poesia/erase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pablomarcos.me/posts/poesia/erase/</guid><description>This text, or at least a very similar one, I wrote it around November 2015, that&amp;rsquo;s why I have put this date; however, the photo is much later, from Villalba in 2020. Curiously, I wrote it to prepare myself for the First Certificate in English, although my teacher didn&amp;rsquo;t like very much that it was so dramatic ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. But that&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;m better now :D
